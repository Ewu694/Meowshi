# Meowshi
**Meowshi is an arcade-style game where our sushi-cat protagonist has to go through a sushi restaurant avoiding the grips of hungry customers! <br>
Throughout the game there will be power ups for our cat protagonist to use. The wasabi power-up will provide the player with a shield that tanks one hit for the player, while the rice power-up will temporarily double the score gain. <br>
Survive for as long as you can!** <br>
*The game can be found on https://ewu694.itch.io/meowshi !*
